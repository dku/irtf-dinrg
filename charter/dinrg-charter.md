# Charter for Research Group

The Decentralized Internet Infrastructure Research Group (DINRG) will
investigate open research issues in decentralizing infrastructure
services such as trust management, identity management, name
resolution, resource/asset ownership management, and resource
discovery. The focus of DINRG is on infrastructure services that can
benefit from decentralization or that are difficult to realize in
local, potentially connectivity-constrained networks. The objective of
DINRG is to 1) investigate (understand, document, survey) use cases
and their specific requirements with respect to implementing them in a
distributed manner; 2) to discuss and assess solutions for specific
use cases with a focus on Internet level deployment issues such as
scalability, performance, and security; 3) to develop and document
technical solutions and best practices; 4) to develop tools and
metrics to identify scaling issues and to determine whether components
are missing; and 5) to identify future work items for the IETF. Other
topics of interest are the investigation of economic drivers and
incentives and the development and operation of experimental
platforms. DINRG will operate in a technology- and solution-neutral
manner, i.e., while the RG has an interest in distributed ledger
technologies, it is not limited to specific technologies and or
implementation aspect. We expect DINRG to advance the state of the art
with respect to fostering a better understanding of the merits and
constraints of specific technologies with respect to the DINRG use
cases.

## Motivation
The internet was designed as a distributed, decentralized system. For
example, intra- and inter-domain routing, DNS, and so on were designed
to operate in a distributed manner. However, over time the dominant
deployment model for applications and some infrastructure services
evolved to become more centralized and hierarchical. Some of the
increase in centralization is due to business models that rely on
centralized accounting and administration.

However, we are simultaneously seeing the evolution of use cases
(e.g., certain IoT deployments) that cannot work (or which work
poorly) in centralized deployment scenarios along with the evolution
of decentralized technologies which leverage new cryptographic
infrastructures, such as DNSSEC, or which use novel,
cryptographically-based distributed consensus mechanisms, such as a
number of different ledger technologies.

The evolution of distributed ledger technologies and the platforms
that leverage them has given rise to the development of decentralized
communication and infrastructure systems, and experiments with the
same. Some examples include name resolution (Namecoin, Ethereum Name
Service), identity management (OneName), distributed storage (IPFS,
MaidSafe), distributed applications, or DApps (Blockstack), and IP
address allocation and delegation.

These systems differ with respect to the problem they are solving, the
specific technologies that they apply, the consensus algorithms that
are employed, and the incentives that are built into the system. Now
is a good time to investigate these systems from an Internet
technologies perspective, and to connect the domain expertise in the
IRTF and IETF with the distributed systems and decentralized ledgers
community.

## Research Challenges
While intensive there is currently intensive research and development
taking place around decentralized applications, the problem of
decentralized infrastructure is receiving relatively less attention,
despite the research challenges in this space. Some of these
challenges include:

* Scalability - what are the problems that prevent decentralized
  infrastructure services from achieving global scale?
* Trust management in decentralized communication settings
* Privacy and targeted, verifiable disclosure
* Applicability of distributed ledger and related technologies to
  different use cases and environments
* Consensus algorithms for specific scenarios with a focus on Internet
  infrastructure services
* The ability of constrained nodes to benefit from elements of a
  consensus item that they cannot process or store as a complete set
* Distributed Trust and Delegated Computing
* Economic drivers and roadblocks for decentralizing network
  infrastructure
* Identification of common requirements and properties of selected
  technologies
* Design and implementation of one or more general-purpose
  infrastructure systems
* Deployment and operation of one or more actual implementations

## Organization
DINRG provides an open forum for the exchange and analysis of
Decentralized Infrastructure-related research. Work that is based on
implementation experience is given preference. DINRG uses an open
mailing list as the main collaboration tool, and will hold regular
several physical meetings per year. DINRG will meet at least once per
year at IETF meetings but will also reach out to other communities and
hold meetings at their respective events such as conferences, project
or standards meetings etc.

DINRG will coordinate and leverage synergies with other IRTF groups
such as T2TRG, ICNRG, and Crypto Forum RG. Also, DINRG intends to
establish a productive working relationship with experts from IETF
working groups in different areas, specifically in the Security,
Internet, and Operations areas.
