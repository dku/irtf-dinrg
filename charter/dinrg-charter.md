# Charter for Decentralized Internet Infrastructure Research Group

The Decentralized Internet Infrastructure Research Group (DINRG) is a
forum to discuss Internet centralization and corresponding phenomena
and threats in the IRTF/IETF community and to investigate research
issues in decentralizing Internet infrastructure.

Its objectives are:

* to facilitate continuous efforts to identify topics in an open forum
  environments;
* to produce useful insights, recommendations and technology
  components that could help to make the Internet work better;
* to perform and discuss measurements and analytical work on existing
  Internet infrastructure;
* (**NEW:**) to investigate and document technology consequences and societal
  impacts of Internet centralization;
* to generate knowledge and explore technical solution for
  facilitating decentralized system development; and to
* maintain broader perspective, including Internet architecture and
  technology and societal perspective, also informing other bodies,
  such as policy making, and regulation.

DINRG will operate in a technology- and solution-neutral manner and is
not limited to specific technologies and or implementation aspects. We
expect DINRG to advance the state of the art with respect to fostering
a better understanding of the merits and constraints of specific
technologies with respect to Internet decentralization.

## Research Topics

The research work in DINRG is structured in two main areas:

### Analytical Work

* Characterizing and assessing Internet centralization, including
  measurement work;
* Assessing technology consequences and societal impacts of Internet
  centralization; and
* Analyzing associated threats and documenting them.

### Exploration of Decentralized Systems and Applications

* Investigating options for decentralizing control power;
* Developing and discussing experimental solutions; and
* Exploring system aspects with respect to future architecture and
  technology aspects, Internet and Web security architectures.

## Way of Working

DINRG welcomes contributions within these two research topics and aims
to identify specific research topics for continuous collaborative or
individual work and will be an open forum for related research
communities (e.g., network security, web evolution, decentralized
systems) for identifying future work and cross-disciplinary exchange.

DINRG will meet at least once per year at IETF meetings and then hold
additional meetings, either at the IETF, as standalone interim
meetings, or as co-located meetings at conferences and similar
events. Selected meetings will be focused on individual research
topics and be held as workshops.

DINRG will coordinate and leverage synergies with other IRTF groups
such as T2TRG, ICNRG, and Crypto Forum RG. Also, DINRG intends to
establish a productive working relationship with experts from IETF
working groups in different areas, specifically in the Security,
Internet, and Operations areas.

DINRG will also provide input to interested external organizations
such as policy making and regulatory bodies.
